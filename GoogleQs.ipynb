    " The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the input of S = \"abppplee\" and D = {\"able\", \"ale\", \"apple\", \"bale\", \"kangaroo\"} the correct output would be \"apple\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The words \"able\" and \"ale\" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than \"apple\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"bale\" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"kangaroo\" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures. Itâ€™s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big-O performance is often worthwhile, as is careful exploration of common and worst-case input conditions."
